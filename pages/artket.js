                    First, I brainstorm to determine what colors, hues, fonts,
                    and shapes best match my personality and convey the message
                    I want to send. Online tools that generate palettes based on
                    a couple of colors work wonders for this. Once I have a
                    selection that I like, I tweak a few colors and see if they
                    still fit. For this specific website, I decided to keep it
                    more minimalist and didn't use all of the hues provided
                    since the page is expected to showcase a few pictures and
                    drawings, and too many colors would make it look visually
                    cluttered.

                  <p>
                    My signature is my brand, so why not use it literally? As
                    you can see, my scribbled name is a constant feature across
                    the pages, and it redirects you back to the home page.

                    Choosing fonts is one of my favorite parts of the design
                    process, as a font can convey so much more than the word it
                    represents. I chose Italiana, a sans-serif font that is
                    elegant and sophisticated without being classic or
                    old-fashioned. For a readable and softer experience, I chose
                    Abhaya Libre, a rounder serif counterpart based on the
                    Sinhalese alphabet. Do you agree that they complement each
                    other well?

                      As I think of the functionalities and features I want for
                      the website, I generate new ideas and add them to the
                      page. Several ideas were suggested for the light-dark
                      switch, and after gathering opinions and feedback to
                      ensure clarity and ease of use, we concluded that the most
                      compact and clear option was the one that you can actually
                      switch :) :)

                    To create the moon design, I used the classic waxing and
                    waning crescent moon emojis from Twitter and slightly
                    modified them to match the appropriate color scheme, as well
                    as adding some haloes.

                    In the end, I decided that warm colors are more fitting than
                    the black and white version of the same. Plus, drawing is
                    fun, so I added a playful Procreate-made version of myself
                    to the mix.

                  I began creating the holistic concept of the website by
                  designing the homepage using Figma. At first, I planned to
                  base it on round shapes and arches to convey a more organic,
                  flowing feel. However, upon further consideration, I found
                  that using straight lines as a theme resulted in a cleaner and
                  more streamlined design that was easier to navigate and
                  understand.

                    Here is the Figma home frame, which is coded to a high

                    and I implemented the responsive design when coding.
